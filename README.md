# Conure
A small, dynamically-typed, object-oriented scripting language made in C that takes inspiration from Python, JS, and Ruby<br/>
(Default compile scripts require [GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org)/[LLVM](http://llvm.org) (these can also be run on Windows using Bash))<br/>
(Will migrate to [CMake](https://cmake.org) if this language gets bigger)
